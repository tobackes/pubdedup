This is currently only a collection of the code.

The pipeline folder has all the top-level scripts that are calling some of the python scripts in the code folder.

For the code to run there needs to be a resources folder, which could not be added due to overall- and individual-file-size limitations.

In general, if you are interested in running the code and obtaining the datasets, please get in touch!
